    <h1>Advanced Smart Pool Water Quality Monitoring System</h1>
    <p>
        Production-grade IoT system for continuous, automated monitoring
        and management of swimming pool water chemistry.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a production-grade IoT system designed to provide
        continuous, real-time monitoring of swimming pool water quality.
        It addresses the real-world challenges of inconsistent water chemistry,
        excessive chemical usage, and labor-intensive manual testing commonly
        found in residential and commercial pool maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike periodic manual testing using strips or handheld meters,
        the system delivers 24/7 sensor-driven data, precise chemical
        adjustment calculations, and automated alerts. It eliminates guesswork,
        reduces chemical waste, protects pool infrastructure, and ensures
        a consistently safe and comfortable swimming environment.
    </p>

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        The system follows a layered, modular architecture centered around
        an Arduino-based controller (Arduino Mega for expanded I/O capacity).
        Dedicated sensor subsystems handle TDS/salinity, pH, and temperature,
        each with appropriate signal conditioning and calibration logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Processed data is displayed locally, logged for long-term analysis,
        and transmitted wirelessly for remote monitoring. The architecture
        supports bidirectional data flow, enabling both local interaction
        and cloud-based oversight.
    </p>

    <h2>Hardware & Sensor Subsystems</h2>

    <h3>TDS / Salinity Sensing</h3>
    <p>
        An analog TDS sensor with stainless steel electrodes measures water
        conductivity to estimate dissolved solids concentration. Because
        conductivity varies with temperature, raw readings are compensated
        using real-time temperature data to produce accurate ppm values,
        critical for saltwater pool management.
    </p>

    <h3>pH Sensing</h3>
    <p>
        A combination pH electrode with a high-impedance amplifier board
        provides stable voltage output for accurate pH measurement.
        The system supports two-point calibration using standard buffer
        solutions, with calibration coefficients stored in EEPROM to
        compensate for probe drift over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Temperature Sensing</h3>
    <p>
        A waterproof DS18B20 digital temperature sensor provides water
        temperature data used both for display and for compensating
        electrochemical sensor readings. Its 1-Wire interface ensures
        reliable operation with minimal wiring.
    </p>

    <h3>User Interface & Data Logging</h3>
    <p>
        A 16x2 I2C LCD displays real-time parameters and system messages.
        A four-button tactile interface enables menu navigation, calibration,
        and log access without a computer. A microSD card logs timestamped
        sensor data in CSV format for long-term trend analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>Wireless Connectivity</h3>
    <p>
        An ESP8266 WiFi module provides TCP/IP connectivity for cloud
        dashboards and NTP time synchronization, while an HC-05 Bluetooth
        module offers local configuration and data access via smartphone.
        Dual communication paths ensure operational flexibility and redundancy.
    </p>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Data Processing & Control Logic</h2>
    <p>
        The firmware is built around a non-blocking finite state machine (FSM)
        that manages monitoring, menu navigation, calibration routines, and
        log viewing without halting system operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sensor data is sampled at fixed intervals using millis()-based timing,
        filtered using moving averages, validated against physical limits,
        and compensated for temperature effects before being displayed,
        logged, or transmitted.
    </p>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Chemical Calculation Engine</h2>
    <p>
        The system translates raw sensor data into actionable maintenance
        instructions. For saltwater pools, it calculates the exact mass
        of salt required based on current salinity, target salinity,
        and configured pool volume.
    </p>
    <p>
        pH adjustment logic estimates the quantity of acid or base needed
        to reach target pH levels, warning users to apply chemicals gradually.
        This precision prevents chemical over-dosing, infrastructure damage,
        and unsafe swimming conditions.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Firmware Architecture & Reliability</h2>
    <p>
        The firmware is modular and maintainable, with dedicated modules
        for sensors, calculations, storage, communication, and user interface.
        Calibration data and system configuration are preserved in EEPROM,
        while SD card logging provides long-term historical records.
    </p>
    <p>
        Watchdog timers, sensor validation checks, and fail-safe defaults
        ensure stable 24/7 operation even under partial hardware or
        communication failures.
