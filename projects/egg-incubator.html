    <h1>Programmable Automatic Egg Incubating Machine</h1>
    <p>
        Fully automated egg incubation system designed to maintain stable
        environmental conditions over a complete 28-day incubation cycle.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project involved the design and deployment of a fully automated,
        industrial-grade egg incubation system built to address high chick
        mortality caused by inconsistent environmental control and labor-intensive
        manual monitoring in small to mid-scale poultry operations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system autonomously maintains precise temperature, humidity,
        ventilation, and egg-turning conditions throughout the complete 28-day
        incubation cycle, eliminating human intervention and ensuring consistent,
        repeatable hatch outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>System Architecture & Subsystems</h2>

    <h3>Temperature Control</h3>
    <p>
        Multi-level regulation using two W1209 digital thermostat controllers
        with K-type thermocouples. One controller manages the primary heating
        element, while the second provides redundant oversight, maintaining
        stability within ±0.5 °C of the 37.8 °C setpoint.
    </p>

    <h3>Humidity Management</h3>
    <p>
        A dedicated water reservoir with an ultrasonic mist maker controlled
        by a humidity sensing module. Control logic regulates misting duty
        cycle to maintain 55–65% RH, with programmable adjustments during
        final hatch phases.
    </p>

    <h3>Automatic Egg Turning Mechanism</h3>
    <p>
        An AC-powered swing motor with a programmable timer drives a camshaft
        connected to egg trays, rotating the tray assembly 45 degrees every
        four hours to prevent embryo adhesion and mimic natural hen behavior.
    </p>

    <h3>Ventilation & Air Circulation</h3>
    <p>
        High-volume DC axial fans establish forced-air circulation, ensuring
        uniform temperature and humidity distribution while maintaining
        adequate oxygen levels and CO₂ removal.
    </p>

    <h3>Power System</h3>
    <p>
        Primary AC operation with automatic failover to a 12 V DC battery
        system during mains failure, supported by an integrated charging
        controller for battery readiness.
    </p>

    <h2>Control Logic & Automation Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        The automation architecture follows a phased incubation state model
        consisting of pre-heat, main incubation, lockdown, and hatch stages.
        Each sensor–actuator pair operates in closed loop, supervised by
        central logic to ensure stability and fault tolerance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Redundant temperature monitoring, continuous ventilation, and
        interval-based egg turning minimize single-point failures and
        environmental drift across the incubation cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>Power Failover & Reliability Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        A DPDT relay-based automatic AC–DC switching system ensures uninterrupted
        operation during power outages. When mains power is available, the
        system operates on rectified DC while charging a 12 V 100 Ah battery
        bank. Upon failure, the load is instantly transferred to battery power.
    </p>
    <p>
        This design provides approximately three hours of uninterrupted
        operation, preventing temperature drops that could otherwise lead
        to embryo mortality.
