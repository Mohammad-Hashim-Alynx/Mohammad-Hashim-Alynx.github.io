    <h1>Automatic Inline Water Pressure Booster – ESP32</h1>
    <p>
        Flow-based intelligent booster pump controller designed for reliable,
        real-world deployment with zero manual intervention.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a flow-based intelligent inline booster pump controller
        designed to solve critical problems of pump dry-running, energy waste,
        and hardware wear in residential, commercial, and agricultural water
        pressure systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike conventional pressure-switch controllers that rely on indirect
        pressure changes, this system uses direct Hall-effect flow sensing to
        activate the pump only when genuine water demand exists, ensuring
        efficient operation and extended pump lifespan.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        The system is built around an ESP32 microcontroller as the central logic
        unit, selected for its dual-core processing, precise timing, and reliable
        GPIO handling. A YF-S201 Hall-effect flow sensor provides real-time flow
        data, which the ESP32 processes to control a high-current relay driving
        the AC booster pump.
    </p>
    <p>
        The firmware uses a fully non-blocking, millis()-based timing architecture
        to guarantee deterministic behavior and uninterrupted long-term
        operation.

    <h2>Hardware Subsystems</h2>

    <h3>Flow Detection Subsystem</h3>
    <p>
        A YF-S201 Hall-effect flow sensor is installed inline with the water pipe.
        Each turbine rotation generates a pulse, captured via a hardware
        interrupt on the ESP32. Software debouncing and averaging ensure
        accurate, noise-immune flow measurement.
    </p>

    <h3>Control & Logic Subsystem</h3>
    <p>
        The ESP32 executes a deterministic state machine using interrupt-driven
        pulse counting and non-blocking timing. All thresholds and timings are
        configurable constants for easy field tuning.
    </p>

    <h3>Power Switching Subsystem</h3>
    <p>
        A Songle SRD-05VDC-SL-C relay module provides opto-isolated switching
        between the low-voltage control electronics and the high-voltage AC
        booster pump, ensuring electrical safety and reliability.
    </p>

    <h3>User Feedback Subsystem</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> System ready, no flow</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Flow detected, activation pending</li>
        <li><strong>Green + Relay:</strong> Pump active</li>
        <li><strong>Red:</strong> Fault condition</li>
    </ul>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Control Logic & State Machine</h2>
    <p>
        The controller operates using a three-state machine: STANDBY, ACTIVE,
        and COOLDOWN. Flow is sampled over a fixed window to validate genuine
        demand before activation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Minimum ON and OFF timers prevent short cycling, while dry-run detection
        ensures immediate shutdown if flow is not detected after pump startup.
        Non-blocking timing allows continuous system supervision without
        watchdog resets.
    </p>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Firmware Design & Source Code</h2>
    <p>
        The firmware follows a single-threaded, non-blocking super-loop
        architecture with interrupt-driven flow sensing. All delays are managed
        using millis(), eliminating blocking calls and improving reliability.

    <h2>Safety & Protection Mechanisms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dry-run detection with immediate pump shutdown</li>
        <li>Anti-short-cycling enforcement using minimum ON/OFF timers</li>
        <li>Opto-isolated relay protection for AC mains</li>
        <li>Fail-safe defaults ensuring pump OFF on reset or fault</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Installation & Deployment Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The controller is installed inline between the water source and the
        booster pump. The flow sensor is mounted using standard pipe fittings,
        and the control unit is housed in a ventilated enclosure with full
        electrical isolation between AC and DC domains.
