    <h1>IntelliFlow™ – Smart Water Pump Automation System</h1>
    <p>
        Production-grade, electrode-based water pump controller with failsafe protection,
        dry-run prevention, and autonomous operation for critical water infrastructure.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        IntelliFlow is a production-grade water pump automation system designed
        for critical water infrastructure where reliability is non-negotiable.
        It eliminates the failure modes of float switches and timer-based
        controllers by enforcing deterministic, sensor-verified operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system protects pumps from dry-running, prevents tank overflow,
        handles intermittent water sources, and rejects false triggers caused
        by turbulence or debris. It operates fully autonomously without cloud
        dependency and is suitable for 24/7 deployment in municipal, agricultural,
        and industrial applications.

    <h2>Sensor Calibration Procedures</h2>
    <p>
        Professional calibration ensures accurate water detection with
        appropriate thresholds and timing adjustments for different water
        conductivity levels.
    </p>
    
    <figure class="diagram-section">
<pre class="diagram">
🎯 ADC THRESHOLD CALIBRATION:

LOGIC: INVERTED - Lower ADC values = Water present
Default thresholds: 1000 for all electrodes

CALIBRATION PROCEDURE:
1. DRY SENSOR READING:
   • Keep electrodes dry
   • Monitor serial for ADC values
   • Typical "dry" reading: >2000

2. WET SENSOR READING:
   • Submerge electrodes in water
   • Monitor ADC values
   • Typical "wet" reading: <500

3. SET THRESHOLD:
   • Choose value between dry and wet
   • Example: dry=2500, wet=300 → threshold=1000
   • Adjust in code and re-upload

📊 SERIAL MONITOR EXAMPLE:
Electrode 1: 2450 = DRY
Electrode 2: 2350 = DRY  
Electrode 3: 2400 = DRY
(Values drop when water present)

⚙️ TIMING ADJUSTMENTS:
// All in milliseconds (adjustable):
STABILIZATION_DELAY = 180000        // 3 minutes
MAX_WAIT_FOR_ELECTRODE2 = 300000    // 5 minutes
SINGLE_LOSS_DELAY = 15000           // 15 seconds
DUAL_LOSS_DELAY = 7000              // 7 seconds
TANK_FULL_STOP_DELAY = 3000         // 3 seconds
AUTO_RESET_DELAY = 1200000          // 20 minutes

🔧 FOR TESTING (temporary):
STABILIZATION_DELAY = 10000         // 10 seconds
AUTO_RESET_DELAY = 30000            // 30 seconds

    <h2>Safety Features & Protection Mechanisms</h2>
    
    <figure class="diagram-section">
<pre class="diagram">
🛡️ MULTIPLE PROTECTION LAYERS:

1. 🏜️ DRY RUN PROTECTION:
   • Electrode 1 monitoring: Must detect water to start
   • Electrode 2 verification: Must confirm actual flow
   • Dual-point verification: Both sensors must agree
   • Timed cutoffs: 15s single loss, 7s dual loss

2. 💦 OVERFLOW PREVENTION:
   • Electrode 3 monitoring: Detects tank full condition
   • Confirmation delay: 3-second delay prevents false triggers
   • Audible alarm: 5-second buzzer alerts user
   • Automatic shutdown: Pump stops immediately

3. 🩺 SYSTEM HEALTH MONITORING:
   • Reset cause detection: Identifies unexpected reboots
   • Error LED indication: Pulses for 1 hour after reset
   • State persistence: Maintains state through minor issues
   • Graceful recovery: 20-minute cooldown prevents rapid cycling

4. ⚡ ELECTRICAL SAFETY:
   • Optimal GPIO selection: Avoids problematic pins
   • Relay isolation: Separates control and pump circuits
   • Current limiting: Resistors protect all outputs
   • Noise filtering: Capacitors on ADC inputs

🎯 FAILSAFE BEHAVIORS:
• Single sensor failure: System continues with reduced safety
• Multiple failures: Enters safe shutdown mode
• Complete failure: Defaults to pump OFF state
• Clean power loss: Resumes from waiting state
• Brownout detection: Identifies and reports
