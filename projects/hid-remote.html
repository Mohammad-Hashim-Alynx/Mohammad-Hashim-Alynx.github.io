    <h1>Alynx – ESP32-C6 BLE HID Gamepad Controller</h1>
    <p>
        Cross-platform, low-latency Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) HID gamepad
        designed for universal compatibility and reliable wireless input.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Alynx is a standards-compliant BLE HID gamepad controller designed to
        function as a native input device across Windows, Linux, macOS,
        Android, and iOS without custom drivers. It addresses limitations
        of proprietary or wired controllers by offering low latency,
        low power consumption, and flexible firmware-based customization.
    </p>
    <p>
        The controller implements the HID over GATT (HoG) profile, allowing
        it to be instantly recognized by host operating systems as a
        generic game controller suitable for gaming, robotics teleoperation,
        media control, and accessibility interfaces.
    </p>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        The system is built around the ESP32-C6 microcontroller, which provides
        native Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy support and efficient RISC-V processing.
        Physical button inputs are sampled via GPIO, encoded into compact HID
        input reports, and transmitted wirelessly to the host using BLE
        notifications.
    </p>

    <h2>Hardware Design & Input Subsystems</h2>

    <h3>Button Input Design</h3>
    <p>
        Seven digital buttons are connected to ESP32-C6 GPIOs configured with
        internal pull-up resistors. Buttons pull the input low when pressed.
        Software debouncing ensures reliable state detection without false
        triggers caused by mechanical bounce.
    </p>

    <h3>Status LED</h3>
    <p>
        A dedicated status LED provides immediate feedback for BLE states,
        including advertising, active connection, input acknowledgment,
        and potential low-battery warnings.
    </p>

    <h3>Power System</h3>
    <p>
        The controller is powered by a single-cell 3.7 V Li-Po battery regulated
        to 3.3 V using an LDO. The design supports untethered operation and can
        be expanded with onboard charging via a TP4056 module.

    <h2>BLE HID Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        Alynx implements a fully compliant BLE HID device using the HID over
        GATT profile. The controller advertises the Human Interface Device
        service and exposes the required characteristics for HID information,
        report mapping, control, and input reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Input reports consist of a compact three-byte structure representing
        seven digital buttons and two centered axes, minimizing BLE packet
        overhead and ensuring low-latency input delivery.
    </p>

    <h2>Firmware Architecture & Control Logic</h2>
    <p>
        Firmware is developed using ESP-IDF and follows an event-driven,
        non-blocking architecture. GPIO scanning runs continuously, while
        BLE events are handled via callback functions. Input reports are
        transmitted only when a debounced state change is detected.
    </p>
    <p>
        This change-only reporting strategy minimizes radio usage, reduces
        power consumption, and ensures responsive input handling within
        BLE connection interval limits.
    </p>

<section class="reveal">
    <h2>Power Management & Performance</h2>
    <p>
        In active BLE connection mode, the system typically consumes
        8–15 mA depending on connection interval configuration. Event-driven
        reporting keeps the radio idle when no inputs change, extending
        battery life without sacrificing responsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
        BLE connection parameters can be tuned to balance latency and power
        consumption, enabling sub-30 ms response times while maintaining
        efficient energy usage.
